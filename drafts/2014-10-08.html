<h3>2014.10.8 tilde crash</h3>
<p>Logged in to tilde.club last night via sftp to back up my site once i saw that nothing was lost in the crash. Felt a little like cheating. It's interesting that i was followed by a couple of fellow tildenizens on twitter during the outage, and i followed some too. It's like we needed the break from the site itself to connect other ways, and also a way to stay on top of some of the community; otherwise impossible with now 615 members (though not all active yet).<p>
