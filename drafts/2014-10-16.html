<h3>2014.10.16 TC Club Meetup report</h3>
<p>Twin Cities tilde clubbers had a meetup yesterday: 5 members, maybe the biggest one yet? The peak MN Tilde Club moment was realizing that we were having a discussion of usenet history on a rooftop garden in October, with the sun setting and the fall chill setting in, yet all were reluctant to end the meetup just yet. But all good things, etc., so we got together for a picture and called it a night soon after. </p>
